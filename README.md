# Price Today System - System Analysis and Design

This project focuses on the analysis and design of a price monitoring system. The goal is to create a system that can effectively track and analyze price data for various products, providing valuable insights for businesses and consumers.

## Project Overview

The price monitoring system will collect price data from multiple sources, such as online retailers, physical stores, and market research companies. The data will be processed and stored in a database, allowing users to access and analyze it through a user-friendly interface.

The system will provide various features, including:

*   **Real-time price tracking**: Monitor price changes for products in real-time.
*   **Price history**: View historical price data to identify trends and patterns.
*   **Price alerts**: Receive notifications when prices for specific products change.
*   **Price comparison**: Compare prices for products across different retailers.
*   **Data visualization**: Generate charts and graphs to visualize price data.
*   **Reporting**: Create custom reports to analyze price data.

## System Architecture

The system architecture will consist of the following components:

*   **Data collection**: Web scraping, APIs, and manual input.
*   **Data processing**: Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
*   **Database**: Stores price data and other relevant information.
*   **User interface**: Web-based interface for accessing and analyzing data.
*   **Reporting module**: Generates reports and visualizations.

## Diagrams

The following diagrams will be created as part of the system analysis and design process:

*   **Context Diagram (Three Levels):**
    *   Level 0: Shows the system as a whole and the interactions with external entities.
    *   Level 1: Shows the major processes within the system and the data flow between them.
    *   Level 2: Provides more details about the sub-processes within each major process.
*   **Database Diagram**: Illustrates the structure of the database, including tables and the relationships between them.
*   **Other Diagrams**: Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams.

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript
*   **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
*   **Web framework**: Django, Spring, React
*   **Cloud platform**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
